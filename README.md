# Product Embeddings Search Application - TODO List

## Overview
This document outlines the remaining tasks to be completed for the Product Embeddings Search Application. The application aims to store product embeddings in a PostgreSQL container, allow querying, calculate cosine similarity, and provide a user-friendly interface through a Flask application.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Storing Products and Embeddings in PostgreSQL Container
- **Task**: Implement functionality to store product data and their corresponding embeddings in the PostgreSQL database.
- **Details**:
  - Create a function that takes product details and embeddings as input.
  - Use SQL commands to insert this data into the `products` table.

### 2. Querying Products
- **Task**: Develop a querying mechanism to retrieve products based on user input.
- **Details**:
  - Create an API endpoint in Flask that accepts user queries.
  - Implement logic to fetch relevant products from the database.

### 3. Finding Cosine Similarity with Top K Results
- **Task**: Implement cosine similarity calculation to find the top K similar products.
- **Details**:
  - Use NumPy or another library to compute cosine similarity between the query embedding and stored embeddings.
  - Return the top K results based on similarity scores.

### 4. Integrating with Basic Flask App
- **Task**: Finalize the integration of the backend with the Flask application.
- **Details**:
  - Set up routes for displaying HTML pages and handling form submissions.
  - Ensure smooth interaction between the frontend and backend components.

### 5. User Interaction with HTML Pages
- **Task**: Create user-friendly HTML pages for interaction.
- **Details**:
  - Design a search page where users can input queries.
  - Display results in an organized manner, showing product names and similarity scores.

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize tasks based on dependencies (e.g., storing data should be completed before querying).
2. Assign deadlines for each task to ensure timely completion.
3. Test each component thoroughly after implementation to ensure functionality.

## Conclusion
Completing these tasks will result in a fully functional Product Embeddings Search Application that allows users to efficiently search for similar products based on their embeddings.
